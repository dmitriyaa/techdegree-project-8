# Accessibility Refactor
## Treehouse Techdegree Project 8
One of 12 **_Front End Web Development_** projects at [Treehouse Techdegree Courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development)

## Project Desription
Accessible web sites allow anyone and everyone to use the web, regardless of physical or hardware differences. They also, generally, make sites faster to download and easier to parse for software like search engines. More accessible web sites are also starting to be given higher PageRank scores for web searches.

For this project I modified the website files provided for the rock band â€œAccessible Frog" to improve the site's accessibility for users:
* I've chosen a safe and accessible (AA) color palette, according to the *Contrast Ratio*
* Improved the HTML structure by applying HTML5 tags
* All images now have *alt* attribute
* Links are distinctly visible and have hover states
* Table is now properly structured with td, th, scope and caption elements
* Form is also properly set up
* The code was checked via Chrome Accessibility and Firefox Fangs tools with no errors
